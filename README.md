# 🧠 iHub-Data Internship 2025 – Object Detection using YOLOv8

Welcome to my internship repository for the **iHub-Data Internship Program 2025**, organized by **IIIT-Hyderabad**. This repository contains my work across all 5 tasks assigned during the internship, focusing on mastering **YOLOv8** for various object detection challenges.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The internship focused on:
- Understanding and applying **Object Detection** techniques.
- Working with **YOLOv8** developed by Ultralytics.
- Building skills by exploring hands-on, real-world tasks.
- Learning independently with minimal guidance, like an industry R&D workflow.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Task 1](https://github.com/Gnanasree12/iiit_internship/blob/main/Internship_Task_1.ipynb) | Ran YOLOv8 on sample images using pretrained weights. Verified model installation and inference. |
| [Task 2](https://github.com/Gnanasree12/iiit_internship/blob/main/internship_task_2.ipynb) | Applied YOLOv8 on local images, multiple image folders, and video files. Extracted frames and saved predictions. |
| [Task 3](https://github.com/Gnanasree12/iiit_internship/blob/main/intenship_task3.ipynb) | Performed object detection on real-world traffic videos. Segmented frames, saved visual outputs, and interpreted detections. |
| [Task 4](https://github.com/Gnanasree12/iiit_internship/blob/main/intenship_tast_4.ipynb) | Created a custom dataset using Roboflow. Annotated accident-related objects, exported in YOLO format. |
| [Task 5](https://github.com/Gnanasree12/iiit_internship/blob/main/task_5.ipynb) | Trained a YOLOv8 model on the custom dataset and ran predictions. Generated detection videos and visualized prediction accuracy. |

## 🏁 Final Outcome

- ✅ Trained a **YOLOv8 model** on a **custom accident detection dataset**.
- 🎯 Generated a **predicted output video** with frame-by-frame detection.
- 📊 Visualized **metrics and performance graphs** during training and evaluation.
- 🎓 Successfully completed all tasks under the iHub-Data Internship Program.
